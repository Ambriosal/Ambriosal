## Welcome! I'm Osa ✨ 

I'm a software eng student with a minor in Neuroscience, based in Ontario, Canada. I'm passionate about cybersecurity, game development, and exploring how technology intersects with the human brain. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing video games 🎮 or doing yoga 🧘‍♀️.

Fun fact: I'm a huge of fan of the Legend of Zelda!
